# PowermateCpp
A cross platform library for the Griffin Powermate controller

This library heavily utilises the **hidapi** library by **signal11**
[hidapi](https://github.com/signal11/hidapi)

# Usage

Included in the Libs folder are precompiled versions of hidapi for both Mac and Windows
These are just to speed up the setup, you are probably better off compiling it for your own usage

## Mac 
The hidapi library requires IOKit and CoreFoundation frameworks
